        <h1>The Way of Kings</h1>
        <p>Author: Brandon Sanderson</p>
        <p>The Stormlight Archives #1</p>
        <p>
          Foreword: Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of
          incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that
          they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in
          shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless
          ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.
        </p>

        <p>
          It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders
          known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate
          remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men
          into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades.
          Wars were fought for them, and won by them.
        </p>

        <p>
          One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains.
          There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to
          protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that
          makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single
          foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who
          consider them expendable.
        </p>

        <p>
          Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his
          brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The
          Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and
          the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train
          under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece,
          Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are
          less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah
          hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.
        </p>

        <p>
          The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building,
          The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight
          Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.
        </p>

        <p>Speak again the ancient oaths:</p>

        <p>
          Life before death.<br />
          Strength before weakness.<br />
          Journey before Destination.
        </p>

        <p>and return to men the Shards they once bore.</p>

        <p>The Knights Radiant must stand again.</p>

                alt="This is a picture of Brandon Sanderson, provided by GoodReads, offering an interpersonal viewpoint of the author. Here is a bio from his website: Hello! My name's Brandon. I write science fiction and fantasy stories that focus on complex characters and innovative settings. I'm glad you stopped by.

                I've written a lot over the years. It can be a little daunting to get into my work, but it doesn't have to be. Most of my series can be read independently of one another, and although many of them are connected behind the scenes, references to these things are generally easter eggs or other small-scale connections.

                I thought that here I'd pitch to you a few books—each a good place to start—if you want to dive in. Each book or series I write is usually trying something slightly different, so they each tend to have a unique vibe. The best place for you to start, then, is generally with something that matches your reading tastes. Let me give you a few options. You can click the title of each one to read sample chapters!

                All of these works, save Skyward, take place in the same universe called the Cosmere. The connections are quite ephemeral in these pieces, but watch for a character named Hoid (a.k.a. Wit). He is relevant to each of them in some way or another. Watching for him and trying to piece together his motives is one of the mysteries of the Cosmere.

                Thanks again for looking into my works!"
