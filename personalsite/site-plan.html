			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this website is to serve as a safe, clean, and regularly updated landing page for delivering quick, snappy spurts of motivation wrapped in quotes, links to opensource content, and uplifting media designed to help people elevate their perspective of life. Whether its a quick quote to a statement, question, or an invoking question for others to pursue their aspirations, this is simply again a page to satisfy those attempts to reach people and lift them higher than they were before. None of the content would be advertized, self-serving, or with any particular agenda other than to leave people with hope, even if its merely from what words alone can deliver.</p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>The intended audience would be targeted towards an open demographic that is not limited to anyone in specific, as everyone to a degree struggles with their own sense of empowerment from time to time, this would be intended towards aiding people in finding resources to lift, inspire, and help them better coach themselves on elevating their overall perspective of life.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>Some elements that I could add to make my webpage engaging, useful and push me to further learn js would be to for example: Make an interactive menu (drop-down, hover, and click DOM event handlers), I could add a Carousel/Slider that dynamically makes images or even text change as I slide down the webpage (making both mobile and desktop users experience some level of engagement), could add a light/dark toggle in the header, and maybe even provide a Analytics Chart that displays how many people have signed up for a weekly newsletter, or have visited the webpage and unlocked the daily quote (triggered and opened based off of a button on the webpage?). These are just a few of the ideas that I have had while brainstorming this week.</p>

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>[content, images, data for the home page] -- linked on a google keep page that I have for tracking all of my site content</p>
			<h3>Ignite Your Why</h3>
			<p>[content, images, data for the subpage] - added on my wireframe that will be exported to my google keep for my site content</p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wire-frames for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				The Landing page has most if not all of the content/interactions that I am going to add to it, along with subnotes as to what I want them to do and how they will interact together. The other content that will need to be added are images, attributed or created, as well as integrating the sizing conventions for the overall layout. The wording to specific words will also need to be added here for expositional content, as I've only included basic content outlined within my diagram, I will use this as a basic reference to get started.
			</p>

			<h3>Ignite Your Why</h3>
			<p>
				There are going to be several scrolling effects, as well as click and prompted events that will be triggered within this page, as well as, there is additional content that will need to be written for the middle of the page. This is in specific regards to the statistic bubbles that I want to create that will have hover animations, and have content for a guided process of 'igniting the why' daily, this will be needed so that the content is relevant, purposefully driven, and not drive off visitors with created content.
